- Image optimization and processing
- Real-time performance with Socket.IO across all organizational levels
- Proper indexing and data modeling

### Security

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Enhanced**: Role-based authorization for workspaces and boards
- Password hashing with salt
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- File upload security

### Developer Experience

- Comprehensive TypeScript typing
- Consistent code patterns and conventions
- Detailed documentation and comments
- Error handling and logging
- Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Nodemon)
